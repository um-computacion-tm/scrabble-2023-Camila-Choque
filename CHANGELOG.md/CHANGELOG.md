## [0.0.4] - 2023-08-28

### Added

   -Added the draw_tile method to the Player class to allow players to draw tiles and add them to their hand.
   -Added the test_draw_tile test case to the TestPlayer test suite.
   -Created an instance of the Player class for testing.
   -Added a tile "B" to the player's hand using the draw_tile method.
   -Verified that the tile "A" is not present in the player's hand using the self.assertNotIn assertion.

## [0.0.5] - 2023-08-29

### Added

    -The draw_tiles method takes two arguments: bag (an instance of the BagTiles class) and num_tiles (the number of tiles 
     the player wants  to draw from the bag).
    -The method checks if the requested number of tiles (num_tiles) is less than or equal to the number of tiles in the bag (bag.tiles).
    -If the condition is met, the method adds the specified tiles (num_tiles) to the player's hand (self.tiles) 
     using extend and then     removes those tiles from the bag using del bag.tiles[:num_tiles]
     -Modifications were made to the 'draw_tiles' test.
     
    -Added the exchange_tiles method to the Player class to facilitate tile exchange between a player and a bag of tiles.
    -The method takes two arguments: bag (an instance of the BagTiles class) and tiles_to_exchange (a list of tiles to exchange).
    -It checks if all the specified tiles in tiles_to_exchange are present in the player's hand (self.tiles).
    -If all the specified tiles are found, the method extends the bag with the exchanged tiles (tiles_to_exchange) 
     and removes these tiles from the player's hand.
    -The method returns True if the exchange is successful, indicating that the tiles were successfully exchanged.
    -If the condition is not met, it returns False, indicating that the exchange was not possible due to missing tiles in the player's hand.

    -A test for this method was created.
    
## [0.0.7] - 2023-09-06

### Added
  
    
    -Implemented the next_turn method in the ClassName class to switch to the next player in the game's turn.
    -If the current player is None, it is set as the first player in the list of players.

       position is already occupied.
    
    
## [0.0.24] - 2023-10-11 


### Changed
      
     -Method modification: The place_tiles method was modified to enable tile placement on the board.
     -Added validations: The method checks whether the location_x and location_y coordinates are within the board boundaries 
      (between 0 and 14) before proceeding with the placement.
     -Cell validation implemented: It verifies if the cell at the specified location already contains a letter (cell.letter is None) 
      before adding a new letter to the board.
     -Boolean return value: If all conditions are met, the tile letter is added to the cell, and True is returned to 
      indicate successful placement. If any of the conditions are not met, False is returned to indicate unsuccessful placement.
